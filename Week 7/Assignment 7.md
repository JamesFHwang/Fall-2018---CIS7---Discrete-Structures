Due 11/17 11:59:59pm

Write a program that prints out step-by-step instructions for completing the Tower of Hanoi.

Requirements:

    - [ ] Asks the user for 1 integer indicating the number of disks to use.  Then have the program solve the Tower of Hanoi problem recursively.
	- [ ] Have the program print out each move (for example: "Move disk from tower A to tower C")
	
	If you are comfortable solving this using OOP, then:	
	- [ ] Next have the program print out a visual representation of each tower in between moves.  For instance, after the first move, the console could show:
	```
	Tower A: -,2,3
	Tower B: -,-,-
	Tower C: -,-,1
	Move disk 1 to Tower C
	```	
    - [ ] After each move, wait for user input and clear the screen
    
    	If you are NOT comfortable solving this using OOP, then:
	- [ ] Write another program that simply outputs the factorial of a given input
